Brief Introduction 

A highly driven System Engineer with extensive experience in infrastructure security, threat detection, and network monitoring. Skilled in incident response, system security, and cybersecurity defense, ensuring robust protection for enterprise environments. With a strong foundation in networking, operating systems, and Linux, I hold certifications in these areas and continuously expand my expertise in Cybersecurity Essentials, Network Defense, and Cyber Threat Management. Passionate about securing systems and mitigating cyber threats, my goal is to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst or pursue a role as an Entry-Level Penetration Tester.

## Objective


To leverage my expertise in infrastructure security, threat detection, and network monitoring to protect and secure enterprise environments. I aim to apply my skills in incident response, system security, and cybersecurity defense in a dynamic Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst or as an Entry-Level Penetration Tester. Committed to continuous learning and professional growth, I seek opportunities to enhance cybersecurity strategies, mitigate threats, and contribute to a resilient security posture.
